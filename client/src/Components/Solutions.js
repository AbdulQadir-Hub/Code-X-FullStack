        The healthcare industry is facing challenges like high costs, stringent
        government regulations, lengthy insurance procedures, security and
        confidentiality issues, in addition to providing quality medical care.
        Industries are adopting IT solutions to streamline information flow and
        address these problems. Some of the advantages include:
        <br />
        <br />
        - Increased efficiency through better customer management, billing
        processes, clinical data storage, and claims management, generating more
        revenue through improved customer service.
        <br />
        - Reduced operational costs by eliminating administrative costs related
        to paper records.
        <br />
        - Minimization of errors and redundant information through multiple data
        entries.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, implementing these IT solutions comes with challenges such as
        integration and interoperability issues, security risks, and compliance
        with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
        standards.
