      <h3>Web Design</h3>
      <p>
        Along with the development of software applications and eCommerce
        systems, Code-X Technologies is pleased to provide you with web design
        services. When we start working on your project, our goal is to make
        sure that the final result meets these three key objectives:
        <br />
        1. Web-site appeals to the target audience
        <br />
        2. Web-site is easy to use
        <br />
        3. Web-site is effective
        <br />
        You can create a bright flashy site with lots of animation and cool
        effects, however if your target audience is the financial industry, then
        it will not be attractive to them. And vice versa, a lot of numbers and
        facts won’t appeal to the teenage crowd. They would appreciate a site
        that targets their emotions. So before starting the design process, we
        take time to analyze and understand your audience, their desires, and
        motives.
